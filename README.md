## Currency Converter Flutter ðŸ’±
This is a currency converter app made using Flutter and Provider state management library. The app allows users to convert between different currencies using the latest exchange rates from the [openexchangerates.org](openexchangerates.org) API. The app is designed to be simple, fast, and reliable. The app also stores the last currencies converted, so that it can restore it when reopened.
